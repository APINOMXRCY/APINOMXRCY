After hovering over the playbutton, click F8


# What does it do?

I dont know exactly the XP given, but the used Monkeys are leveling extremely fast, the farm has permanent clicking feature to not stop the farm after leveling up, the only problem is (thats why it not a 100% auto farm) because of the collection event
