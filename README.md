12. Open Tinytask, click on save and copy paste it 3 times (if you accidently overwrite the one you dont lose it)
13. Now last point, do everything AS FAST AS POSSIBLE, to get the most profit out of it, dont forget to wait about 3 seconds at the end of the round because the alchemist throws are randomized and the round can end faster or slower.
